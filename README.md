# Pixels Metaverse 

## Pixels Metaverse Introduction：
<!-- Pixel Metaverse was born during the competition of the first Metaverse Training Camp held by the Pure White Matrix and Metaverse Foundation in early September, and was independently completed by [xiangzhengfeng](https://github.com/xiangzhengfeng) individuals over a period of 15 days and won the first place in the competition. The developer's personal energy was limited and he was left to the Pixels Metaverse team for development and maintenance. -->

The Pixel Metaverse is a world drawn 100 percent by the player, in which every resident can copy and clone everything in reality. Cosmic inhabitants are not bound by random numbers and can decide for themselves their cosmic identity, appearance, equipment and assets. There are various identities and functions in the universe for residents to choose from, such as the choice of doctors, policemen or businessmen. As a doctor, he can change the sex or appearance of the residents. As a businessman, he can make glasses, masks, hats and other products for sale.

## Pixels Metaverse Features

* Highly autonomous: The Pixel Metaverse is a highly autonomous and decentralized, user-owned assets that are chained and cannot be tampered with or forged. All assets are not stored on any centralized server, and information such as the user's blockchain identity can be drawn through the open-source front-end UI component only after the blockchain has been acquired, and is not tied to any resource links.

* Assetization of Everything: The Pixel Metaverse contract inherits all the interfaces and functions of the ERC721 standard, and all assets can be fully chained. All the objects, organs, assets, etc. in the universe are ERC721 standard TOKEN, everything in the universe has been TOKEN.

* Lego: Users can reconfigure and configure themselves through contracts, which are particularly strong. The more refined the products produced by merchants, the more composable the residents are, the clearer and richer the universe, and the true realization of NFT fragmentation.

* Cosmic hierarchy: The Pixel Metaverse is divided into five levels, each of which is a separate contract, and all assets are in the same ERC721 contract. Residents at each level have different behaviors and styles. Such as the hierarchical layer of the universe residents only have the function of running and jumping, and insight into the autumn milli-layer universe can play competitive games. The thinner the universe can support pixels, the richer its functions will be. The universe is constantly socialized, and its development is getting closer to the real world.

## The status quo and future of the Pixels Metaverse 

The current metacosm supports only 20px pixel drawing, that is, only the drawing of head information, which also implies the Pixel Metaverse, starting from scratch. Current residents can upload images of organs or objects and generate pixel paintings using algorithms. Merchants can generate and distribute assets corresponding to that pixel site by copying the pixel painting. Residents can purchase the asset and decide whether to allocate the asset to chain identity.

The current universe initially had 10,000 primitive inhabitants, which were residents of the Genesis Pixel Metaverse. When the universe escalates into a cloud of smoke, it is when the body and limbs can be drawn. The original inhabitants can choose their occupation and gender or identity, and after a certain period of time they can have children through a pair of men and women, and each child can have children by pairing them. The total population of the universe is 1024,000, until the total population of the universe is reached
Add new residents.

The metacosm at the highest level can experience most real-world life, where residents can build houses and furniture through carpentry, and so on, while taxi drivers can quickly get residents to their destinations without transportation, while residents without transportation can only spend more time and energy. Residents can experience the old and the sick, rich and ugly, and so on, to satisfy your innermost fantasy of their ideal identity.

The scenes of the future universe can be abundant, all of which are realized by the joint action of all the inhabitants. So, join the Pixel Metaverse, let's create our own universe. In the world of the Pixel Metaverse, fly freely.



## The project starts
```sh
1. yarn
2. yarn start
```

> The current project is based on the truffle framework development, if just looking at the project does not require installation, if you need to redeploy the contract, you need to install truffle, specifically refer to [the truffle framework documentation](https://learnblockchain.cn/docs/truffle/index.html)

> After the contract is deployed, the publisher of the 721 contract token needs to be set up, and can write the code to invoke the interface, or install it [contract-json-converted-html](https://github.com/xiangzhengfeng/truffle-contract-json-converted-html) The npm package, which converts the smart contract json file generated by truffle directly into an html file, automatically generates visual pages to call and view data.


## react-pixels-metaverse
All drawings are encapsulated and pulled out of the project, and any project party or website can be installed [react-pixels-metaverse](https://github.com/UniqueDAO/react-pixels-metaverse) 
The npm package, and the introduction of UI components in its own project, passe in the user's address or identity data to generate his Pixel Metaverse identity pattern.

## The current task
1. Redesign the project structure and refocus the project, separating transaction and circulation functions such as NFT and economic models to ensure that the project is operating in compliance.
2. Optimize the contract as a whole, add some fields, and remove some code or variables that don't need to be chained, and optimize the contract as a whole to ensure a significant reduction in gas consumption.

## Next plan
1. Optimize the overall project to be compatible with mobile web pages
2. Optimize the decryption data algorithm to minimize gas consumption
